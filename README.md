# code-by-caleb

Hi, you're probably here because you clicked on the link I provided on my resume. First of all, thank you for taking a look. Second, when I first wrote the resume I was fairly new to Github
and put all of my coding projects in a single repository (thinking that that would organize them all in one place for employers to see). This was that repository. But I soon realized that this idea
only caused confusion and inconvenience for both myself and anyone interested in downloading any of my code. So I have since then organized my projects into separate repositories, and this
repository merely serves as a welcome mat. To see the real stuff, navigate to my other repositories or just click here: https://github.com/theonenottaken?tab=repositories. Thanks!
